## Troubleshooting Reference

If you encounter issues, refer to:

- **Detailed troubleshooting**: See `DEPLOYMENT-QUICKSTART.md` section "Troubleshooting"
- **Deployment status**: Check `DEPLOYMENT-STATUS.md`
- **DNS issues**: See `decap-proxy/DNS-SETUP.md`
- **Worker setup**: See `decap-proxy/README.md`

## Common Issues

### "Client ID not configured" error
- ✅ Verify both secrets are added in Cloudflare Workers settings
- ✅ Redeploy the worker: `cd decap-proxy && npm run deploy`

### Worker domain not responding
- ✅ Use "Add Custom Domain" in Workers dashboard (not manual DNS)
- ✅ Wait 5 minutes for DNS propagation
- ✅ Check DNS: `dig decap.soundofsimone.no`

### Site not building
- ✅ Check build logs in Cloudflare Dashboard
- ✅ Verify build command is `npm run build`
- ✅ Verify output directory is `dist`

### CMS can't access repository
- ✅ Check GitHub OAuth callback URL is correct
- ✅ Verify OAuth app is authorized
- ✅ Check repository name in `public/admin/config.yml`
